Daf.py 0.1.1 - Data in Axes in Formats
======================================

`DataAxesFormats.jl <DafAxesFormats://github.com/tanaylab/DataAxesFormats.jl>`_ is a Julia package which provides a uniform
generic interface for accessing 1D and 2D data arranged along some set of axes. This is a much-needed generalization of
the `AnnData <https://github.com/scverse/anndata>`_ functionality. This package (``dafpy``) is a wrapper around the
Julia package that allows accessing ``Daf`` data from Python, using the
`JuliaCall <https://github.com/JuliaPy/PythonCall.jl>`_ package.

Installation
------------

Just ``pip install dafpy``, like installing any other Python package.

Usage
-----

The Python package provides the same API as the Julia package, with the following modifications:

- (Most) functions are exposed as member functions of the ``DafReader`` and ``DafWriter`` classes (e.g., write
  ``reader.get_scalar("version")`` in Python instead of ``get_scalar(reader, "version")`` in Julia).

- There is no ``!`` suffix for functions that modify the data (e.g., write ``writer.set_scalar("version", "1.0")`` in
  Python instead of ``set_scalar!(writer, "version", "1.0")`` in Julia.

- ``DataAxesFormats.jl`` supports importing and exporting ``AnnData`` objects. However, since it is a Julia package, these
  objects are **not** Python ``anndata`` objects; instead they use the implementation provides by the
  `Muon.jl <https://github.com/scverse/Muon.jl>`_ Julia package. That is, to import/export ``AnnData`` between ``Daf``
  and Python, your best bet is to go through ``h5ad`` files.

See the [Python v0.1.1 documentation](https://tanaylab.github.io/dafpy/v0.1.1) and [Julia v0.1.2
documentation](https://tanaylab.github.io/DataAxesFormats.jl/v0.1.2) for details.

Status
------

Version 0.1.1 is an alpha release. We hope it is feature complete and have started using it for internal projects.
However, everything is subject to change based on user feedback (so don't be shy). Comments, bug reports and PRs
are welcome!
